# text_summarization.ipynb

This project applies a pretrained **BART model** (`facebook/bart-base`) from Hugging Face to perform **abstractive text summarization**.
The goal is to automatically generate concise summaries of input passages, demonstrating state-of-the-art NLP with transformer-based models.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Motivation
Summarization is a critical NLP task with real-world applications in news aggregation, legal documents, research papers, and customer support.
This project demonstrates how modern transformer models like BART can produce human-like summaries out-of-the-box with Hugging Face.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- Source: **DeepLearning.AI**.
- Format: JSON files (`train.json`) and (`test.json`) with the following structure:
- `dialogue`: original passage
- `summary`: human-written reference summary


Example:
```json
{
"dialogue": "...The Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon in 1969...",
"summary": "Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969."
}
```
---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology
1. Load datasets (`train.json`) and (`test.json`).
2. Initialize Hugging Face summarization pipeline with `facebook/bart-base`.
3. Generate summaries for sample passages.
4. Compare predicted summaries against reference summaries qualitatively.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- The model produces **fluent and concise summaries**.
- Example:
```text
Input: "The stock market crashed yesterday due to global uncertainty..."
Predicted: "Global uncertainty caused a market crash."
Reference: "Stock market crashed due to uncertainty."
```
- Observations:
- Model captures main ideas well.
- Paraphrasing differs from references but remains faithful to meaning.
- Occasional factual drift (hallucination) observed.
